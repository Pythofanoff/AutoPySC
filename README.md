`<DESCRIPTION>`
 
v. of lib: 0.0.1

 AutoPySC or Auto Python Structure Creator - 
 This is a lightweight, simple library for creating a project tree.

 This library was originally written for my own small, private projects, 
but I decided to keep it publicly available. 
Perhaps one day this small script will grow into something bigger.

Creates the following structure:

```
MyProject
├───.git
├───cache
├───docs
├───logs
├───src
│   └───MyProject
│       ├───database
│       ├───images
│       ├───products
│       ├───users
│       └───utils
├───tests
└───venv
    ├───Include
    ├───Lib
    │   └───site-packages
    └───Scripts
```
Time of the structure creation: ~±500 ms

`<HOW TO LAUNCH?>`
